**WARNING:** This is extremely simplified and probably factually inaccurate. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!

To begin our analysis, we need two entities, assuming they are company OA and company MS.

|               | OA | MS |
|---------------|---:|---:|
|**Current**    | 0  | 90 |
|**Investments**| 0  | 0  |
|**Assets**     | 0  | 90 |


MS has 90 cash and decided to invest in company OA, which increase OA's valuation by 10 in a simplified model.

|               | OA | MS |
|---------------|---:|---:|
|**Current**    | 10 | 80 |
|**Investments**| 0  | 10 |
|**Assets**     | 10 | 90 |

OA is using MS's cloud to provide a service, which OA pays MS 10 and the underlying cost for MS is 5.

|               | OA | MS |
|---------------|---:|---:|
|**Current**    | 0  | 85 |
|**Investments**| 0  | 10 |
|**Assets**     | 0  | 95 |

MS then decided to invest 20 cash in OA.

|               | OA | MS |
|---------------|---:|---:|
|**Current**    | 20 | 65 |
|**Investments**| 0  | 30 |
|**Assets**     | 20 | 95 |

At the end of the day, the total assets increased from 90 to 115 - we printed 25 and cost nothing to allow OA to provide free services!
